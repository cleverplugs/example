This is a dagger I see before me all of this,
My hand to handle? Come on, let me hold you tight.
I have you do not, but I still see you.
You are not fatal vision, sensible
To feel, sight? Or art thou goals
Dagger of the mind, a false creation,
From the heat oppressed brain?

I see you, in the form of palpable
All of these I now have this draw.
Marshall you love me, I was going way;
I was so year instrument.
My eyes are made fools O 'L' otherness senses,
Otherwise, it is worth all the rest; I see you still,
And we are your blades and up True Blood ancient Heights,
This is not so before. 

There is no such thing:
It is the bloody business of all it notifies
So, for my eyes. Now, put your half of the world
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
In the curtain sleep; witchcraft celebrate
Pale Hecate products, and you get rid of the murder,
Alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf,
It's howling his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.

With the heady pace 塔昆, and towards their own design
Moving like a ghost. You acidity and firm set on the ground,
Hear my footsteps, which direction they go, for fear
You're a stone complaining my whereabouts,
And take this horrible time,
Now for it. 9:20 I threatened his life:
Words to deeds too cold breath gives heat.
